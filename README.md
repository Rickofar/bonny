# Bonny
Bonny Official website is a cloned of Beyond Box, Guam website. The same design, responsiveness as well as styling. However, I have been able to tweak some of it to suits the purpose. (April 4, 2023)

I will continue to add my personal touch to it until achieve its own uniquness. (April 5, 2023)

Whatever changes I make in the css/main.css file, I will continue to update it here on the readme.md file as well. No copyright infringement intended, however, as an upcoming web developer, I want to try my ability to see how conversant I am with other people's code and how I can interpret them properly. To understand what code does what. It is worthy to note that, on the HOME PAGE, which I termed, "Who's That Girl?", I have been able to tweak the social media buttons using my own codes.

I tried tweaking the home page by adding contents to represent "Bonny Official" website. I did a redesign of the website logo using Adobe Illustrator.

<img src="img/Bonny.png">

I also added placeholder images for some "Feature Songs" content. This I will modify as time goes on. I also effected a media query within the HTML code and also with the help of CSS Bootstrap Framework attached to the original website. 

HTML Code
								<div class="col-md-2 col-md-offset-1 product-header padded-bottom">
									I GUESS YOU WANNA KNOW THAT...
								</div>
HTML Code
								<div class="col-lg-5 col-md-6 col-sm-5 col-xs-6">
									<a href="#"><img class="img-responsive" src="img/two hands up.jpg" alt="Bonny Official"></a>	
									<p>Cactus</p>
								</div>

I have been playing with GitHub and learning how to make my repositories more readable and understandable. This is the major reason I am making a diary of every change I make on the "Bonny Official" website. GitHub is my first hosting platform and it's also acting as my backup in case I need to revert to a previous version of what I have changed.
